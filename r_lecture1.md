# Why R?

* Power
* Range
* Transparency

# Reproducibility crisis

Scientists at Amgen (a drug company) tried to reproduce findings from
53 "landmark" studies.

> ... when findings could not be reproduced, an attempt was made to contact
> the original authors, discuss the discrepant findings, exchange reagents and
> repeat experiments under the authors’ direction, occasionally even in the
> laboratory of the original investigator.

Of 53 studies, only 6 replicated (11%).

# Be transparent in order not to fool yourself

> you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other scientists. You just

Richard Feynman, Cargo Cult Science (1974)

# History of R, part 1: S

* The [S programming
  language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)) by [John
  Chambers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Chambers_(statistician)) ; "to
  turn ideas into software, quickly and faithfully" [@chambers1998programming].
  First version of S in 1976.
* An S program describes the analysis in words (and numbers).
* S is a programming language along with many packages for standard analysis
  and graphics.

# History of R, part 2: R

*    [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) is a free
     version of S, developed by [Ross
     Ihaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ihaka) and [Robert
     Gentleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gentleman_(statistician))
     at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, first released in 1995.
*    Now by far the dominant language in statistics and in many fields of
     science.
*    One of two dominant languages (with [Python](https://www.python.org) for
     data analysis / data science in industry.

# R and other languages

* R and Python
* R and SPSS

# The (ahem) geography of R

* [The base R language](https://www.r-project.org)
* [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com)
* [The R Notebook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html)

# Getting help in R

* The R and R studio interface.
* Your search engine.
* Your colleagues.
