This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. 

You can add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or
by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

We first read the dataset containing information about the passengers (not
crew) who were on the RMS Titanic when it sank.

See the [Vanderbuilt biostatistics datasets](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/DataSets) for more detail on this dataset.

You might also want to look at [Encylopedia Titanica](https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-statistics.html) for
more background.

```{r}
# Read the dataset directly from the URL.  After this, the variable "titanic"
# is a data frame.
titanic <- read.csv("http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/titanic3.csv")
```

Show the names of the columns in the data frame:

```{r}
#- Show the names, with the "names" function.
```

You might want to inspect the data frame as a spreadsheet using RStudio.  To do
this, run the command `View(titanic)`.  See the note at the end about putting
the `View` command in a chunk in your notebook, rather than running at the
R console.

Show the number of rows (passengers) and columns (variables), using the `dim`
command:

```{r}
#- Use "dim" to show the number of rows and columns of the "titanic" data frame.
```

Show the first 6 passengers (rows) in the data frame using the `head` function:

```{r}
#- Show the top 6 passengers with the "head" function.
```

Do a histogram of the passengers ages.  That's the `age` column of the
`titanic` data frame.

```{r}
#- Show a histogram of the patients' ages.
```

Use the `mean` function to show the mean age of the passengers:b

```{r}
#- Show the default result of calculating the mean passenger age
```

Oops.  Now drop the `NA` values, in the mean calculation, with the `na.rm` option:

```{r}
#- Show the result of calculating the mean passenger age, dropping NA values
```

Now do a histogram of the fare that the passenger paid.  The column name is `fare`.

```{r}
#- Show a histogram of the fares paid.
```

As you get older, you get richer (at least, that's how it seems to us, your
instructors).  So, did the older passengers pay a higher fare?  Do a plot to investigate.

```{r}
#- Plot age (x-axis) against fare (y-axis)
```

Not very convincing!

That's it.  Before you submit:

* Remember that you should submit the `.Rmd` file, not the `.nb.html` file, nor
  any of the other files that the R notebook makes.  Make sure your notebook
  file does have the extension `.Rmd`.
* Before you submit this notebook for marking, make sure that all the chunks
  execute correctly.  To do that, go to the Run button at the top of the
  notebook, and click "Restart R and Clear Output".  Then go to the top of the
  notebook, and run each chunk in turn, to make sure that they run without
  error, and give you the output you expect.  *Remember, we're going to run an
  automated marking script over this file, so it has to execute correctly, for
  you to get the marks*.   You can make your life a bit easier by making sure
  that you don't have any `View` commands in your notebook chunks.   If you
  don't have any of these, you can go to the Run button and choose "Restart R
  and run all chunks" - this will run the whole notebook.   Then you can check
  the output is OK in the notebook, and submit.  If you do have `View`
  commands, this doesn't work because the notebook execution blocks as it does
  the `View`.  In that case, you have to run each chunk one by one.
