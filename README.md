# R teach out

See the: `r_lecture1_handout.pdf` in this repository.

## The introduction tutorial

Follow this tutorial - [R from scratch](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/r-from-scratch)

It covers the material you need to fill in your first notebook - see below.

You will need to make a free DataCamp account to do the tutorial, but the
R from scratch course is completely free (see below).

**Hint 1**: Work slowly, read carefully.

**Hint 2**: don't ask your neighbors for help until you've read the instructions
again, and thought about the problem for at least a few minutes.

At various points, DataCamp will put up splash screen asking you to "Upgrade
your account to continue" with "Full access to all courses".  Just press Escape
(the Esc key) to continue without upgrade.  You do not need to upgrade to do
this course.Be careful - the completely free "R from scratch" course sends you
off to do a section from the not free course called (oddly) "Free introduction
to R".  Because that course is not free, when you get to the end of the first
section, and try to go on to the next section, DataCamp will try and force you
to pay.    You do not have to pay.   To avoid this, stop when you've finished
the last page of the free section, called "What's that data type", and come
back to the "Variables interlude" page of the "R from scratch course, and
continue from there.See this video for an explanation, if you get stuck.

## The practice notebook

Here's a link to a [short video about getting going with the
R notebook](https://vimeo.com/319738376).

Download the zip file first_rnb_practice.zip

I suggest you download this file to your Desktop folder.

Extract the files from the zip file.  On Windows, right click on the file and
choose "Extract all".  Extract to the Desktop folder.  On Mac, find the
downloaded zip file, open it, and select the option to open with Archive
Utility. 

In either case, you should have a new file "first_rnb_practice.Rmd".

Now open R Studio (use the Windows Start Menu in Windows, or Spotlight on Mac).
When R Studio is open, use the File menu to open the "first_rnb_practice.Rmd"
file.

See the assignment page at Statistics - Semester 1 Independent Learning
& Assignment Part 1 for more detail on installing and running R Studio, and
setting up the R Studio notebook.
